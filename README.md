# Initial Stakes
This is the first repository of my Github account.Hence it contains codes of certain classical DP and Greedy algorithms,various Sorting and Searching algorithms and also implementation of certain Data Structures in JAVA.Also since, I am a beginner it may contain lot of redundant and unoptimized code.


# Contribution :
If you find some issues with the code or if you want to optimize the code.Please post an issue or better if you do a PR and submit your optimized/corrected version of the code.
